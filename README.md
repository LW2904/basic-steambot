## Building a bot with the Steam API and NodeJS

I am going to be making this bot step-by-step using [node-steam-user](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user), which is a handler Module of [node-steam](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam) which in turn is a port of [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit).
Now, this is mostly just formalities and you won't need to know (or even really understand) this to build this bot so the important thing we should take from this is: we are using node-steam-user as our interface with the steam servers.

### NodeJS

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LW2904/basic-steambot/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
